I was once a student at Sharon High School, and those years were truly unforgettable. The friendships I formed and the lessons I learned shaped who I am today. From engaging classes to memorable events, every moment was filled with growth and discovery. I cherish the support of my teachers and the vibrant community that made my high school experience so special. Looking back, I am grateful for the foundation Sharon High School provided me as I embarked on my journey.

I grew up in the city of Xi'an, one of the oldest cities in China, and it holds a special place in my heart. The rich cultural heritage and historical relics, like the Terracotta Army and ancient city walls, are a constant reminder of the city's vibrant past. Walking through its streets, I feel a deep connection to the history that have shaped my identity. Xi'an is not just my hometown; it's a treasure trove of memories and experiences that I cherish dearly.
