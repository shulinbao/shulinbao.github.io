Hi there, welcome to my homepage! I‚Äôm Steve Haonan MA (È¶¨ÈÉùÊ•†), a creative engineer in the humanities and arts with a cross-cultural and interdisciplinary background. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree at the <span style="#000066">School of Communication, Hong Kong Baptist University</span> <img src="https://www.comm.hkbu.edu.hk/comd-www/lib/ico/android-icon-192x192.png" width = 15 height = 15>, one of the top institutions in Asia for communication studies. Through my research and projects spanning computer science, history, literature, and culture, I am committed to promoting cross-disciplinary collaboration among scholars from diverse backgrounds.

With over 8 years of programming experience and a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures, I am proficient in using C/C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript to develop complex, large-scale projects. I have also participated in digital humanities projects at the University of Hong Kong and Nanjing Normal University, focusing on natural language processing (NLP) and quantitative stylistics (QS). I am currently developing HorseGPT (https://gpt.nu.ac.cn), an open generative AI platform that provides various AI services while researching user habits in utilizing such services.

In addition to my technical expertise, I am also a professional scholar in academic and intellectual history. I am skilled in a variety of textual analysis techniques, including linguistics, rhetoric, palaeography, and the study of ancient scripts such as Oracle Bone Script, Bronze Script, and Xixia Script. As a communication scholar, I integrate these skills with research in political communication and computational communication to discuss the insights from great thinkers in human history. My research has been published in well-known academic journals such as 21st Century and others.

Beyond my research, I actively collaborate with universities and enterprises to explore the possibilities of the humanities and arts in the digital age. In addition to ongoing curating and art auctions, I have many ideas that I‚Äôm eager to share with friends. If you're interested in these topics, feel free to reach out to me anytime! üòä
