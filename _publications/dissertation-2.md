category: dissertations
excerpt: 'This dissertation employs methods such as paleography and comparative philology to conduct a preliminary study of the handwriting in the *Book of Songs* 詩經 from various states as presented in the *Warring States Period Collected by Anhui University* 安大簡. In the introduction, the author traces the history of the scholarship and research methods, arguing for the necessity of studying the handwriting in the *Warring States Period Collected by Anhui University*. In the first chapter, the author examines the handwriting characteristics, word usage, and errors in the "Guofeng" 國風 sections of the *Book of Songs* from a micro-level perspective, following the order of the various states. In the second chapter, the author takes a macro-level approach, investigating the overall characteristics of the handwriting, word forms, word usage, errors, omissions, the scribal quality, and symbolic markings in the *Book of Songs* of the *Warring States Period Collected by Anhui University*, and explores the information related to the text that is revealed through the handwriting.'
