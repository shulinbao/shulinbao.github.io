excerpt: 'This article employs methods such as paleography and comparative philology to conduct a preliminary study of the handwriting in the Book of Songs (Shijing) from various states as presented in the An Dajian edition. In the introduction, the author traces the history of the scholarship and research methods, arguing for the necessity of studying the handwriting in the An Dajian Shijing. In the first chapter, the author examines the handwriting characteristics, word usage, and errors in the guofeng (airs of the states) sections of the Shijing from a micro-level perspective, following the order of the various states. In the second chapter, the author takes a macro-level approach, investigating the overall characteristics of the handwriting, word forms, word usage, errors, omissions, the scribal quality, and symbolic markings in the An Dajian Shijing, and explores the information related to the text that is revealed through the handwriting. In the conclusion, the author provides a brief overview of the overall condition of the handwriting in the Shijing and the information it presents, and makes preliminary inferences about the textual and scribal background of the An Dajian Shijing, such as the date of transcription and the condition of the scribe.'
