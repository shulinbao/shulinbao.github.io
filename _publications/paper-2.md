excerpt: 'Unlike the "dominant paradigm" of "modernity" discussed by Arif Dirlik in terms of its "hegemonic position," in the process of the shift from the intellectual history narrative of the 1980s to that of the 1990s, the "space for intellectual choices" not only never shrank, but on the contrary, expanded. However, this expansion of "choice space" did not come about through the hoped-for "dialogue between the present and the past, or between contemporary historians and their predecessors." Instead, the reconstruction of the narrative of "modernity" in the intellectual history beginning in the late 1980s not only caused a rupture between new and old narratives, but also led to the departure of key arguments and concepts that once held a crucial position within the old narrative, further contributing to the internal changes and gradual collapse of the new narrative.'
