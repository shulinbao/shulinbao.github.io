excerpt: 'On the basis of reviewing Liang Qichao''s "New Historiography" research in the past 70 years, this article sorts out the changes in the academic circle''s description of Liang Qichao''s "New Historiography", and discusses the changes in the academic circle''s understanding of a problem in the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China in the past 70 years. It can be seen that the disintegration of the "materialist view of history" and the "class view of history" in the 1980s forced the academic circles to start from Liang Qichao''s "new historiography" itself and establish new clues and discussions. The differences between different scholars in this process have led to the gradual emergence of two opposing "new historiography" discourses. Both discourses stem from similar academic motivations, but are influenced by different methodologies and different attitudes toward the problems of the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China. Therefore, the formation of the monopoly position of academic historians on the problem of "new historiography" is not just a simple process of "scholars stand out and thinkers fade out", nor does it mean that the research of academic historians is complete in the sense of methodology.'
