title: 'Study on Historical Geography of Baguazhou (1912-1949) 八卦洲歷史地理研究'
collection: publications
category: dissertations
excerpt: 'This dissertation provides a preliminary analysis of the historical geography of Baguazhou 八卦洲 from 1912 to 1949, covering key topics such as natural geography, political boundaries, population, and economic development during this period. By clarifying the fundamental historical and geographical issues, the study identifies a clear diachronic development of Baguazhou, which can be divided into two distinct phases, with 1927 serving as a key turning point. This division highlights the existence of a "threshold" in the region’s development, influenced not only by the natural geographical environment but, more importantly, by the prevailing models and mechanisms of development. This underscores the significance of social factors in shaping the regional historical geography. Additionally, the study of Baguazhou's regional historical geography serves as a valuable case study, offering insights that may be applied to the research of other related historical topics.'
