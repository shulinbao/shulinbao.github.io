excerpt: 'In this paper, the historical geography problems of Baguazhou from 1912 to 1949 are preliminarily sorted out, including the discussion of the historical natural geography, political area, population, economic development and other topics of Baguazhou during this period. On the basis of clarifying the basic historical and geographical issues, it is believed that the diachronic development process of Baguazhou from 1912 to 1949 can be clearly divided in a phased form, that is, the two stages with 1927 as the dividing line. This shows that in the process of regional development, there should be such a "threshold", which is not only affected by the natural geographical environment, but more importantly by the development model and development mechanism, which reminds us of the social nature of the regional historical geographic process The importance of factors. In addition, the regional historical geography research of Baguazhou is used as an example, and it also has reference value for the research of other related historical issues.'
