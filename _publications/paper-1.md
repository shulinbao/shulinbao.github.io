excerpt: 'The Fupu 賦譜 discovered in Japan in the 1940s is a rare record of various norms for writing Fu 賦 by people at that time, which enables us to better understand the structural characteristics of the Tang Dynasty''s Lufu 律賦. Currently, there are mainly three kinds of annotations of the Fupu that are commonly used, They are A Brief Introduction of Fu Pu by Stephen R. Bokenkamp, Annotations of Fupu by Bowei Zhang 張伯偉, and Annotations of the Manuscripts of Fupu in Tang Dynasty by Hanglun Zhan 詹杭倫. This article compares the three most commonly used Fupu annotations in the academic circle, reviews the three annotations, and discuss the influence of the differences of the three kinds of annotations on academic research.'
