excerpt: 'Pattern and Form: A Study of Inner Asian Cities Around 1000 AD is a groundbreaking work that examines the urban layouts and architectural forms of major cities in Inner Asia during the medieval period, particularly focusing on the cities of the Khitan Liao and Western Xia dynasties. Drawing on both literary and archaeological sources, this book explores the spatial and symbolic relationships between urban design and political power, shedding light on how city planning was influenced by cultural, political, and ritual factors. By offering in-depth case studies of the Liao capital of Shangjing and the Western Xia capital of Zhongxingfu, the book reveals how the orientation, layout, and spatial organization of these cities reflect the evolving nature of political authority and cultural traditions in the region. This work is an essential contribution to the study of historical urbanism, providing valuable insights into the interplay between power and space in the development of medieval Inner Asian cities.'
