title: 'Liang Qichao and His Historical Thoughts in the Age of Modern Transformation of Communication 梁啟超的「新史學」及其傳播'
collection: publications
category: dissertations
excerpt: 'My research includes a book draft of over 100,000 words, focusing on Liang Qichao 梁啟超 as an early architect of Chinese historiography and examining his frequent shifts between the humanities and sciences, along with the circumstances and reasons behind them. An article of mine currently under review at the Bulletin of the Institute of Modern History, Academia Sinica explores how Liang Qichao synthesized elements of traditional Confucian classics with Japanese sociology to create Chinese historiography. This article has received positive feedback from peer reviewers, who noted that it challenges conventional narratives of the history of Chinese historiography. Another article, under review at New History, explains how Liang Qichao transformed the historiography he developed into a social science. Peer reviewers have called it the most in-depth study of Liang Qichao's writings to date, noting that it addresses several major issues in the history of Chinese historiography.'
