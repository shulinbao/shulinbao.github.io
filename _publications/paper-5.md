excerpt: 'In conjunction with a study of the city’s historical development and spatial organization, the overall layout of Zhongxingfu city also faced east, with the palace situated at the northwest corner of the city, facing east, which did not create a symmetrical structure with the rest of the city. The city also housed east-facing buildings, such as the Chengtian Temple, and government institutions were located in front of the palace’s Chemen Gate. This complex spatial configuration of Zhongxingfu can provide new insights into the relationship between culture, power, and space in the Western Xia regime.'
