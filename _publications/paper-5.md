excerpt: 'In conjunction with a study of the city’s historical development and spatial organization, the overall layout of Zhongxingfu city 中興府城 also faced east, with the palace situated at the northwest corner of the city, facing east, which did not create a symmetrical structure with the rest of the city. The city also housed east-facing buildings, such as the Chengtian Temple 承天寺, and government institutions were located in front of the palace’s Chemen Gate 車門. This complex spatial configuration of Zhongxingfu can provide new insights into the relationship between culture, power, and space in the Xixia 西夏 regime.'
